<h1>Highlighted GST ML Predictions by PMID</h1><h2>PMID: 18454162</h2><p class="sentence"><b>Sentence 0:</b> Overexpression and altered glycosylation of MUC1 in malignant mesothelioma.</p><p class="sentence"><b>Sentence 1:</b> Current interest in the MUC1/EMA mucin relates to its role in malignancy, and its potential as a therapeutic target.</p><p class="sentence"><b>Sentence 2:</b> MUC1/EMA expression has been observed in the majority of epithelioid mesotheliomas.</p><p class="sentence"><b>Sentence 3:</b> However, little is known of the characteristics of MUC1/EMA in mesothelioma.</p><p class="sentence"><b>Sentence 4:</b> Herein, we studied the cell surface and soluble expression of the MUC1/EMA glycoprotein, and determined the mRNA and genomic expression profiles in mesothelioma.</p><p class="sentence"><b>Sentence 5:</b> We found that the anti-MUC1 antibody, E29, was the most diagnostically useful of seven antibody clones examined with a sensitivity of 84% (16 out of 19 cases) and no false positive results.</p><p class="sentence"><b>Sentence 6:</b> MUC1 mRNA expression was significantly higher in mesothelioma samples than in benign mesothelial cells.</p><p class="sentence"><b>Sentence 7:</b> No amplification of the MUC1 gene was observed by FISH.</p><p class="sentence"><b>Sentence 8:</b> Seven of 9 mesothelioma samples expressed MUC1-secreted mRNA isoform in addition to the archetypal MUC1/transmembrane form.</p><p class="sentence"><b>Sentence 9:</b> CA15.3 (soluble MUC1) levels were significantly higher in the serum of mesothelioma patients than in healthy controls but were not significantly different to levels in patients with benign asbestos-related disease.</p><p class="sentence"><b>Sentence 10:</b> CA15-3 in effusions could differentiate malignant from benign effusions but were not specific for mesothelioma.</p><p class="sentence"><b>Sentence 11:</b> Thus, as in other cancers, alterations in MUC1 biology occur in mesothelioma and these results suggest that specific MUC1 characteristics may be useful for mesothelioma diagnosis and should also be investigated as a potential therapeutic target.</p><h2>PMID: 24667139</h2><p class="sentence"><b>Sentence 0:</b> MUC1: a multifaceted oncoprotein with a key role in cancer progression.</p><p class="sentence"><b>Sentence 1:</b> The transmembrane glycoprotein Mucin 1 (MUC1) is aberrantly <span class="highlight">glycosylated</span> and overexpressed in a variety of epithelial cancers, and plays a crucial role in progression of the disease.</p><p class="sentence"><b>Sentence 2:</b> Tumor-associated MUC1 differs from the MUC1 expressed in normal cells with regard to its biochemical features, cellular distribution, and function.</p><p class="sentence"><b>Sentence 3:</b> In cancer cells, MUC1 participates in intracellular signal transduction pathways and regulates the expression of its target genes at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels.</p><p class="sentence"><b>Sentence 4:</b> This review highlights the structural and functional differences that exist between normal and tumor-associated MUC1.</p><p class="sentence"><b>Sentence 5:</b> We also discuss the recent advances made in the use of MUC1 as a biomarker and therapeutic target for cancer.</p><h2>PMID: 30076562</h2><p class="sentence"><b>Sentence 0:</b> Clinic implication of MUC1 O-glycosylation and C1GALT1 in esophagus squamous cell carcinoma.</p><p class="sentence"><b>Sentence 1:</b> Esophagus squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is one of the most aggressive malignant tumors in the world.</p><p class="sentence"><b>Sentence 2:</b> Our previous data demonstrates that oncoprotein MUC1 is related with metastasis and poor outcome of ESCC.</p><p class="sentence"><b>Sentence 3:</b> However, alteration of MUC1 in ESCC remains unclear.</p><p class="sentence"><b>Sentence 4:</b> Using ONCOMINE and COSMIC databases, we analyzed MUC1 gene copy numbers and gene mutations and found that MUC1 had high expression level but few gene mutations in ESCC.</p><p class="sentence"><b>Sentence 5:</b> Further study of ESCC samples indicated that MUC1 O-glycosylation levels were higher in tumor tissues than that in para-carcinoma tissues in 10 of 14 pairs of ESCC samples.</p><p class="sentence"><b>Sentence 6:</b> Moreover, we verified a potential link between MUC1 O-glycosylation and C1GALT1, which was further supported by IHC analysis on 38 ESCC and 19 para-carcinoma samples.</p><p class="sentence"><b>Sentence 7:</b> More importantly, co-expression of MUC1 Oglycosylation and C1GALT1 presented positive correlations with both lymph node metastasis and survival time of ESCC patients.</p><p class="sentence"><b>Sentence 8:</b> Our work collectively indicates that C1GALT1 is associated with <span class="highlight">O-glycosylated</span> MUC1 in ESCC, not only suggesting a diagnostic significance of C1GALT1 and MUC1 O-glycosylation in ESCC, but also opening novel insights into targeting C1GALT1 and MUC1 O-glycosylation to suppress ESCC cells metastasis in patients.</p><h2>PMID: 35909886</h2><p class="sentence"><b>Sentence 0:</b> RUNX3-Regulated GALNT6 Promotes the Migration and Invasion of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cells by Mediating O-Glycosylation of MUC1.</p><p class="sentence"><b>Sentence 1:</b> Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide.</p><p class="sentence"><b>Sentence 2:</b> Dysregulation of messenger RNAs (mRNA) has been recognized to be associated with HCC carcinogenesis and development.</p><p class="sentence"><b>Sentence 3:</b> <span class="highlight">Polypeptide</span> <span class="highlight">GalNAc</span> Transferase 6 (GALNT6), an O-type glycosyltransferase, has been confirmed as tumor promoter in different cancers.</p><p class="sentence"><b>Sentence 4:</b> However, the function of GALNT6 in HCC remains to be studied.</p><p class="sentence"><b>Sentence 5:</b> Methods: RT-qPCR and western blot experiments were, respectively, performed for evaluating RNA expressions and protein levels.</p><p class="sentence"><b>Sentence 6:</b> Supported by bioinformatics analysis, mechanism assays were conducted for validating the potential relation between different genes.</p><p class="sentence"><b>Sentence 7:</b> Functional assays were implemented to analyze HCC cell migration and invasion after different transfections.</p><p class="sentence"><b>Sentence 8:</b> Results: GALNT6 was aberrantly upregulated in HCC cells.</p><p class="sentence"><b>Sentence 9:</b> Knockdown of GALNT6 could repress HCC cell migration and invasion.</p><p class="sentence"><b>Sentence 10:</b> RUNX3 was verified to bind to GALNT6 promoter and activate GALNT6 transcription.</p><p class="sentence"><b>Sentence 11:</b> GALNT6 depletion led to inhibited O-glycosylation and aggravated degradation of MUC1.</p><p class="sentence"><b>Sentence 12:</b> MUC1 overexpression could rescue the impeded HCC cell migration and invasion induced by GALNT6 knockdown.</p><p class="sentence"><b>Sentence 13:</b> Conclusion: To sum up, GALNT6 transcriptionally activated by RUNX3 mediated the O-glycosylation of MUC1, thus exerting promoting influence on HCC cell migration and invasion.</p><h2>PMID:
