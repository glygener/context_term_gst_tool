Fish. 4 mum sections from the tissue microarray were deparaffinised, dehydrated, microwave treated in citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for 10 min, digested in pepsin solution (4 mg ml-1 in 0.01N HCl) for 7 min at 37 C, rinsed in 0.3 M sodium chloride, 30 mM sodium citrate (pH 7.0) at room temperature for 5 min. Dual-probe hybridisation was performed using three SpectrumGreen-labeled BAC clones which encompass the MUC1 gene at 1q22, plus a SpectrumOrange-labeled chromosome 1 centromeric probe (Vysis, Downers Grove, IL, USA) as a control. Seventeen mesothelioma samples were available for FISH analysis.
