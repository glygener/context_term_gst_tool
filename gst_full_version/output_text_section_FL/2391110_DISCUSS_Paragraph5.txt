Paragraph. While the secreted splice form was detected in malignant mesothelial cells, it is of particular note that the expression of the full length, VNTR containing MUC1 gene product was 32-fold higher in mesothelioma than in normal cell preparations. Evidence suggests that this overexpression was not due to a gene amplification event, but to an as yet unknown mechanism. MUC1 overexpression is associated with poor prognosis in breast and lung adenocarcinoma; however, its influence in the prognosis of mesothelioma has not been reported.
