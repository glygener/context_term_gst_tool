Paragraph. Levels of MUC1 gene product in serum and effusions can be determined by several tests, the most common being the CA15-3, mucin-like associated antigen, CA27.29 and CA549 assays. Differences between these tests derived from the monoclonal antibodies used to detect MUC1 epitopes and the sensitivity of the antibodies to the level of glycosylation of the protein. In the current study, the CA15-3 assay was used. The major clinical role of CA15-3 biomarker is in monitoring breast carcinoma metastases and the evaluation of response to treatment. CA15-3 has previously been found in several small scale studies to be elevated in the serum and in effusions of patients with mesothelioma. In the current study, CA15-3 levels were significantly higher in the serum of mesothelioma patients than healthy controls; however, the finding that levels were elevated in patients with benign lung and pleural disease suggests that serum CA15-3 will not be useful as a diagnostic aid for mesothelioma. Elevated levels of CA15-3 in effusions may be a strong indicator of malignancy in general as previously suggested.
