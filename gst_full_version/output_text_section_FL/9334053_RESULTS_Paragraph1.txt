Previous studies have unveiled the oncogenic role of GALNT6 in different cancers, including breast cancer and lung adenocarcinoma. Hence, we aimed to explore the putative role of GALNT6 in HCC. Based on UALCAN (http://ualcan.path.uab.edu/index.html), GALNT6 was discovered to be aberrantly upregulated in HCC tissues (Figure 1(a)). RT-qPCR analysis was then done for the measurement of GALNT6 expression in different cell lines, and the results of which showed GALNT6 expression was much higher in HCC cells than in THLE-2 (Figure 1(b)). Furthermore, Li-7 and Hep 3B (with the highest GALNT6 expression) were selected for subsequent functional assays. The knockdown efficiency of si-GALNT6 was determined in advance (Figure S1A), and si-GALNT6-1/2 was chosen for the higher efficiency. It was suggested in RT-qPCR analysis that GALNT6 depletion led to a decrease in the levels of MMP2 and MMP9 (invasion-related genes), suggesting the suppressive impacts of GALNT6 knockdown on HCC cell invasion (Figure 1(c)). Wound healing outcomes indicated that the migratory ability of HCC cells could be overtly weakened by GALNT6 silence (Figure 1(d)). The inhibitory influences of GALNT6 knockdown on cell migration and invasion in HCC were further confirmed by Transwell experiments as a decline in migrated and invaded cells could be observed as a result of si-GALNT6-1/2 transfection (Figures 1(e) and 1(f)). The above findings together prove that GALNT6, upregulated in HCC tissues and cell lines, can contribute to cell migration and invasion in HCC.
