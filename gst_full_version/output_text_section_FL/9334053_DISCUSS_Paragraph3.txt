Paragraph. To probe into the underlying mechanism contributing to the upregulation of GALNT6 in HCC cells, we conducted bioinformatics analysis and mechanism assays to ravel out the transcription factor of GALNT6. As a result, RUNX3 was discovered as the transcription factor promoting the transcription of GALNT6. Subsequently, considering the role of GALNT6 as an O-type glycosyltransferase, we aimed to figure out the downstream protein whose O-glycosylation could be mediated by GALNT6. With utilization of STRING and UALCAN databases, as well as Co-IP verification, MUC1, an interacting protein of GALNT6 with aberrantly high expression in HCC was screened out. MUC1 has been much investigated regarding to cancer development. For instance, MUC1 as a ceRNA participant has been discovered to promote ovarian cancer progression. The O-glycans of MUC1 has also been reported as a crucial effector in tumor development. As MUC1 is a transmembrane mucin glycoprotein expressed on the surface of almost all epithelial cells, vaccine based on MUC1 has been regarded as a promising method for cancer treatment. In our study, implementation of VVA pull down assay and western blot assay jointly certified MUC1 O-glycosylation mediated by GALNT6 could lessen the degradation of MUC1 protein in HCC cells. The rescue assays further corroborated that GALNT6 exacerbated HCC cell migration and invasion via positively regulating MUC1 expression.
