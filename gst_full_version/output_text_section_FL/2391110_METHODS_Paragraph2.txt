Paragraph. Normal mesothelial cells were recovered from pericardial fluid obtained from patients undergoing intrathoracic surgery as described previously. Serum samples were collected from healthy volunteers, and from patients with the asbestos-related lung disease, asbestosis, and the asbestos-related pleural disease, pleural plaques. Pleural effusion samples were collected from patients with effusions caused by nonmesothelioma malignancy. Effusions were classified as benign (i.e., nonmalignant) on the basis of cytological and immunohistochemical features, and further classified as exudates or transudates on the basis of Light's criteria. Effusions were classified as being associated with an infection if micro-organisms were detected in the fluid. Patient characteristics are listed in Table 1.
