2.7. Western Blot. After the cells were lysed in RIPA buffer, PROTTOT-1KT and Bradford Protein Assay Kit were, respectively, applied to extract total protein and to detect the concentration of the proteins in cell lysates. Later, the proteins treated with 10% SDS-PAGE were transferred onto the PVDF membranes, which were blocked with 5% skimmed milk and then cocultivated with specific primary antibodies against RUNX3, beta-actin, MUC4, or MUC1 overnight at 4 C. Subsequently, secondary antibodies were added for further cultivation at room temperature. Enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system was applied to visualize immunoreactive bands.
