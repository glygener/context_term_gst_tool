Paragraph. Staining was assessed by three observers independently (JC, AS and GS). A positive result was defined as the presence of membranous staining on tumour cells. Staining intensity was graded semi-quantitatively as negative, equivocal (+/-), weak (1+), moderate (2+) or strong (3+). Moderate and strong positivity was only assigned where the majority of cells showed positive staining. Sensitivity was calculated as the total number of moderately and strongly stained mesothelioma samples divided by the total number of mesothelioma samples. Specificity was calculated as the number of negative benign control samples divided by the total number of benign control samples. False positive rate was calculated as the number of moderately and strongly stained benign samples divided by the total number of benign samples.
