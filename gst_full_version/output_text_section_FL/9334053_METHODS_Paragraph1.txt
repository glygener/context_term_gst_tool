2. Material and Methods 2.1. Cell Culture. Normal liver cell line (THLE-2) and three HCC cell lines (HuH-7, Hep 3B, and Li-7) were all purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas, VA, USA). HuH-7 and Hep 3B cells were, respectively, cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media (DMEM; low glucose) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and Eagle's Minimum Essential Medium (EMEM) containing 10% FBS. Li-7 cells were cultivated in RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS. BEGM medium with additional 70 ng/mL phosphoethanolamine, 5 ng/mL epidermal growth factor (EGF), and 10% FBS was used to culture THLE-2 cells. Human embryonic kidney 293T cells were provided by China National Institutes for Food and Drug Control and cultivated in DMEM medium containing 10% FBS and antibiotics. All cells were cultured in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37 C.
