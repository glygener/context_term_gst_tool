Immunohistochemistry. A tissue microarray was constructed by the Western Australian Research Tissue Network (Perth, Western Australia) from archival paraffin blocks. The tissue microarray contained effusion cell pellets from 20 cases of malignant mesothelioma and 16 cases of benign-reactive pleural effusions. Immunohistochemistry was performed using standard techniques. Briefly, sections were deparaffinised with xylene and rehydrated in a graded series of ethanol. Antigen-retrieval was performed for 10 min at high temperature in citrate buffer. Sections were incubated with anti-EMA clones for 60 min and washed in PBS. Immunodetection was performed using Envision+ Dual link detection system (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). For negative controls, the primary antibody was omitted. Antibodies were purchased from various suppliers (Table 2). Some of these antibodies had been previously characterised by workshops organised by the International Society of Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine (ISOBM) in terms of the epitope recognised within the VNTR and whether that recognition was dependent upon the glycosylation status of the epitope. These antibodies were assigned to various classes or clusters by the ISOBM workshops based upon their staining profile on normal breast tissue samples (summarised in Table 2).
