3.3. GALNT6 Mediates O-Glycosylation T of MUC1. Based on recent studies, the oncogenic role of GALNT6 in breast cancer and lung adenocarcinoma is dependent on O-glycosylation. Therefore, we also tended to explore whether GALNT6 modulation mechanism in HCC cells was associated with O-glycosylation of its downstream protein. We firstly searched on STRING (https://string-db.org/) to predict the interacting proteins of GALNT6 and applied UALCAN to predict the expression patterns of the top four proteins with highest score (Figure 3(a)). The expression of MUC5AC in LIHC could not be obtained from UALCAN. Among the other three candidates, MUC1 and MUC4, upregulated in LIHC tissues, were chosen. The results of Co-IP assay revealed the stronger binding between MUC1 and GALNT6 than that between MUC4 and GALNT6, so MUC1 was determined as our research target (Figure 3(b)). Then, several O-glycosylation sites in MUC1 were observed based on NetOGlyc-4.0 (https://services.healthtech.dtu.dk/service.php?NetOGlyc-4.0) prediction (Figure 3(c)). As illustrated in Figure 3(d), GALNT6 depletion resulted in a decline in MUC1 protein level pulled down by vicia villosa agglutinin (VVA), mirroring that GALNT6 might mediate MUC1 O-glycosylation. For further confirmation, Li-7 cells were treated with O-glycosylation inhibitor Benzyl-alpha-GalNAc (BAG). According to VVA lection pull down and western blot analysis, GALNT6 overexpression could contribute to MUC1 O-glycosylation (Figure 3(e)). Additionally, HCC cells transfected with si-NC or si-GALNT6-1 were subjected to cycloheximide (CHX) treatment and the results of western blot analysis verified that GALNT6 depletion could accelerate MUC1 protein degradation (Figure 3(f)). Taken together, GALNT6 mediates O-glycosylation of MUC1 in HCC cells.
