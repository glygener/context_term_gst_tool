Conventional PCR. Conventional PCR was performed with specific primer sets designed for different splice forms as described by and using Taq DNA polymerase (Qiagen). The primer pair Muc1-F (GCACTCACCATAGCACG) and Muc1-R (GGCCAGAGTCAATTGTAC) distinguish between MUC1-TM and a secreted MUC1 isoform, containing the VNTR but lacking the transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail, MUC1/secreted (SEC). PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on 3.5% agarose gel and visualised under UV light with ethidium bromide.
