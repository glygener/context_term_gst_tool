MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients, samples and controls. Serum, pleural effusion and surgically-excised tumour tissue samples were collected from patients following written informed consent. All biospecimens were provided by the Australian Mesothelioma Tissue Bank, a member of the ABN-oncology group, which is supported by the National Health and Medical Research Council, Australia. This study was approved by the human research ethics committees of Sir Charles Gairdner and Hollywood Hospitals, Perth, Western Australia. The final diagnosis in all patients was confirmed by pathologists experienced in the diagnosis of mesothelioma and included clinical follow-up of all cases until death or to last citation in the Public Hospital database system (iSoft Clinical Manager) to confirm that the clinical pattern matched the diagnosis. Mesotheliomas were classified as epithelial, sarcomatoid, mixed or, in cases where diagnosis was made on the basis of immunocytology and there was no histological follow-up, as unspecified.
