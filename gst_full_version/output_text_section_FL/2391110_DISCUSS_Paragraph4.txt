Paragraph. The MUC1 gene product detected in the circulation by the CA15-3 assay contains the VNTR region, therefore the protein may be the archetypal MUC1-TM protein that has been released or cleaved from the cell surface, or may be one of the secreted isoforms. There is some evidence to suggest the latter as the MUC1-SEC was detected by PCR in some of the samples derived from mesothelioma patients, but not from normal mesothelial samples or from cells in the nonmalignant pleural effusions examined. Interestingly, the lack of MUC-SEC expression has been associated with ovarian cancer. Our study used both clinical samples and, in an attempt to limit the influence of nonmesothelial cellular infiltrates, also in vitro cultured homogeneous pericardial cells. It was encouraging to find generally a good correlation between the two sample types, as one concern was that alternative splicing of MUC1 might reflect changes induced by culture.
