3.2. RUNX3 Is the Transcriptional Activator of GALNT6. Next, our emphasis was laid on exploration into the molecular mechanism contributing to the aberrantly high expression of GALNT6 in HCC. It was learnt from previous research that transcriptional factors might activate the transcription of the target genes via binding to the corresponding promoters. Thus, UCSC (http://genome.ucsc.edu/) was applied to predict transcription factors of GALNT6, and three genes (RUNX3, EBF1, and CTCF) were picked out as the candidate transcription factors for their highest cluster score (Figure 2(a)). After determining the respective knockdown efficiency of si-RUNX3, si-CTCF, and si-EBF1 (Figure S1B-D), it was manifested in RT-qPCR results that only RUNX3 depletion resulted in an overt reduction in GALNT6 expression (Figure 2(b)). The binding site of RUNX3 and GALNT6 was predicted on JASPAR (https://jaspar.genereg.net/), and the predicted sequence with the highest score was GGAACCACAACA (Figure 2(c)). In DNA pull down assay, RUNX3 was discovered to be abundantly pulled down by Bio-GALNT6 promoter WT, suggesting the affinity between RUNX3 and GALNT6 (Figure 2(d)). Moreover, according to outcomes of luciferase reporter assay, RUNX3 overexpression could obviously elevate the luciferase activity of pGL3-GALNT6 promoter WT, while that of pGL3-GALNT6 promoter MUT was hardly altered under the same condition, which reflected that RUNX3 could activate the transcription of GALNT6 (Figure 2(e)). The binding correlation between RUNX3 and GALNT6 promoter was further confirmed by ChIP assay (Figure 2(f)). To conclude, RUNX3 can transcriptionally modulate GALNT6 in HCC cells.
