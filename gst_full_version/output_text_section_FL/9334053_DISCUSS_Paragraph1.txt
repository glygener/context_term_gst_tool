4. Discussion. HCC accounts for more than 90% of total hepatic carcinoma cases. As one of the most prevailing malignancies around the world, HCC incidence is still increasing. Normally, infection of chronic hepatitis B and hepatitis C exists as the major reason for HCC induction, while addiction to alcohol, dietary exposure to aflatoxins or aristolochic acid, and liver disease metastasis are all risk factors of HCC. Advancement in molecular pathology has brought about improvement in HCC diagnosis, detailed subtype classification, and prognosis prediction, which also provides help for application of treatment.
