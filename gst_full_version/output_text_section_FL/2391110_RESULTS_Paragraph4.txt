Serum CA15-3 level. The median concentration of CA15-3 in the serum of patients with malignant mesothelioma was 57.4+-2.5 kU l-1 (range, 13-1321 kU l-1); 35% (17 out of 49) of mesothelioma patients had serum CA15-3 above the upper limit of normal (53 kU l-1) (Figure 4A). Though patient numbers were limited, mesothelioma patients with a sarcomatoid or mixed histology had lower serum concentrations of CA15-3 than mesothelioma patients with a predominately epitheliod histology (Figure 4B).
