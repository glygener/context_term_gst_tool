Paragraph. The median CA15-3 concentration in the effusions of patients with nonmesothelioma malignancies was 24+-6 kU l-1 (range, 13-191 kU l-1); CA15-3 was elevated in 24% (6 out of 25) of effusions from these patients. There was no significant difference in the effusion CA15-3 levels between the groups of patients with mesothelioma or other malignancy. Median CA15-3 in effusions of nonmalignant origin was 8.5+-2.9 kU l-1 (range from undetectable to 42 kU l-1). CA15-3 levels were statistically significantly higher in the effusions of patients with mesothelioma than those with benign effusions (P=0.004) (Figure 4C).
