2.2. Cell Transfection. Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) including si-GALNT6-1/2/3, si-RUNX3-1/2/3, si-EBF1-1/2/3, and si-CTCF-1/2/3 were generated to knockdown corresponding genes in HCC cells. The whole sequence of RUNX3 or MUC1 was subcloned into pcDNA3.1 vectors for overexpression of RUNX3 or MUC1 in HCC cells. Scramble siRNAs or empty vector pcDNA3.1 was acquired as negative controls. Plasmid transfection was completed with application of Lipofectamine 2000 in strict accordance with user protocol.
