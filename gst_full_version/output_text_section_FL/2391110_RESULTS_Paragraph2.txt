MUC1 mRNA is overexpressed in mesothelioma cells. The relative expression of the archetypal, full-length, transmembrane MUC1 isoform, MUC1-TM, normalised to GAPDH, was significantly greater in the cells from pleural effusion (P<0.0001) and surgically-excised tumour (P=0.001) mesothelioma samples than that in normal mesothelial cells (Figure 2). Median expression levels were two to threefold greater in malignant mesothelioma samples than in normal mesothelial cells. Expression of MUC1-TM in cells from mesothelioma effusions were significantly greater (P<0.005) than in effusions with benign reactive mesothelial cells. This overexpression was not due to gene amplification as there was no amplification of MUC1 by FISH (data not shown). There was no significant difference in relative levels of MUC1-TM between normal mesothelial cells and from cells obtained from patients with effusions of nonmalignant origin (Figure 2).
