Quantitative PCR. RNA was extracted using Rneasy kits (Qiagen, Clifton Hill, Victoria, Australia), following the manufacturer's protocol. cDNA was generated in a standard reverse transcriptase reaction using oligo dT to prime Superscript II (Invitrogen, Mt Waverly, Victoria, Australia). Quantitative PCR was performed with specific primer sets (MUC1 forward 5'-AGACGTCAGCGTGAGTGATG-3'; reverse 5'-GACAGCCAAGGCAATGAGAT-3') on the iCycler iQ Real Time Detection System (BioRad, Gladesville, New South Wales, Australia) using the QuantiTech SYBR Green PCR Kit (Qiagen). The primers correspond to nucleotides 4757-5017 of the human polymorphic epithelial mucin gene (GeneBank Accession number M61170) and amplify the MUC1-TM product. The relative expression of MUC1-TM was calculated using the standard delta Ct formula as follows:
