2.4. Transwell Migration and Invasion Assay. After transfection of indicated plasmids for 24 h, the cells were added into the apical transwell chamber containing serum-free medium with (for invasion) or without (for migration) Matrigel. The basal Transwell chamber was added with 10% FBS. After 24 h, the cells in the inside of the chambers were wiped off and the successfully migrated or invaded cells on the outside of the chambers were fixed with methanol and dyed with crystal violet. Cell number in 5 randomly selected fields was counted under a microscope.
