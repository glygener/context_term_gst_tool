2.3. Reverse Transcription Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR). After isolation of total RNA from cells with TRIzol reagent, the extracted RNA was reversely transcribed into cDNAs with Reverse Transcriptase Kit. RNA expression analysis was conducted using qRT-PCR kit. The expression of the detected gene was measured by the 2-DeltaDeltaCT method. beta-Actin served as endogenous control.
