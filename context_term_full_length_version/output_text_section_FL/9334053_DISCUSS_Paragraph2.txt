Paragraph. RNAs, either coding RNAs or noncoding RNAs, are recognized as important effectors in the tumor initiation, progression, and metastasis. GALNT6, encoding a number of the GalNAc-T family of enzymes, has been discovered as tumor promoters in various diseases. Consistently, after we confirmed that GALNT6 was upregulated in HCC tissues and cell lines, we also verified GALNT6 could promote HCC cell migration and invasion, implying GALNT6 was an oncogene in HCC.
