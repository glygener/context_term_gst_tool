Paragraph. There are still some limitations in this study included. Xenograft models were not involved to analyze the influence of RUNX3/GALNT6/MUC1 axis on HCC progression in vivo, and clinical samples were not obtained for certifying the correlation between GALNT6 expression and pathological features. Nevertheless, this study could still provide a novel perspective for understanding the molecular regulatory mechanism implicated in HCC.
