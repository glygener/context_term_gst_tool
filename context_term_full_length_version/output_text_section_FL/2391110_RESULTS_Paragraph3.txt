Alternative splice forms of MUC1. Conventional PCR using primers distinguishing MUC1-TM from a secreted isoform of MUC1 which lacks the transmembrane region, MUC1-SEC, demonstrated that approximately half of the samples from malignant mesothelioma cells either from solid tumour or from effusions expressed MUC1-SEC in addition to the transmembrane form (Figure 3). Normal mesothelial cells, either from pericardial fluid or from benign reactive effusions predominately expressed the full length MUC1-TM isoform.
