Effusion CA15-3 level. Levels of CA15-3 in pleural effusions of patients with malignant mesothelioma ranged from undetectable to 2614 kU l-1, with a median of 36.9+-3.9 kU l-1. Approximately 38% (20 out of 52) of mesothelioma patients had CA15-3 levels above the upper limit of normal (53 kU l-1) (Figure 4C). Mesothelioma patients with sarcomatoid histology had lower levels of CA15-3 in their effusion than mesothelioma patients with predominately epitheliod histology, although there was no significant difference between the groups (Figure 4D).
