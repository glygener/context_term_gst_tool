DISCUSSION. Normal/reactive nonmalignant mesothelial cells express predominantly the full-length tandem-repeat containing MUC1-TM, which can be detected on the cell membrane by the Mc5 antibody. In cases of malignant mesothelioma there is an increase in the total quantity of MUC1-TM mRNA expressed, a change in the type of MUC1 isoform produced, an alteration in the epitopes of MUC1 expressed on cell surface and an increase in MUC1 gene product detectable in the circulation.
