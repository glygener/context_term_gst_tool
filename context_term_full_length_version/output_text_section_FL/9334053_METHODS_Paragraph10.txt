2.10. Coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP). The cells were lysed by cold lysis buffer containing complete protease inhibitors and centrifuged at 14,000 x g for 20 min at 4 C. The supernatant from cell lysates was incubated with antibody against IgG or GALNT6. The immunocomplexes were then associated with Protein A-Sepharose. The proteins were then subjected to analysis through western blot.
