Paragraph. The Mc5 antibody was generated against delipidated human milk fat globule and recognises the DTRPAP epitope in the VNTR of the MUC1-TM protein. In the current study the Mc5 antibody recognised membrane associated antigen on mesothelial cells in over half of the effusion samples of nonmalignant origin examined and mesothelioma cells in all of the effusions associated with malignant mesothelioma.) demonstrated that the choice of antibody clone could greatly influence the accuracy of the use of anti-MUC1/EMA antibodies in distinguishing benign from malignant mesothelial cells in a diagnostic setting. This may be one factor in the debate regarding the role of EMA immunohistochemistry in mesothelioma diagnosis. The E29 clone and four of the other clones examined did not recognise MUC1 expressed on benign mesothelial cells. The E29 clone was also generated against delipidated human milk fat globule and recognises an overlapping epitope (the APDTRP epitope) to that recognised by Mc5. It is noteworthy that the E29 clone stains normal breast, intestine and colon. Alteration in MUC1 glycosylation has been reported in many malignancies. The current antibody studies suggest that glycosylation of MUC1-TM is altered in malignant mesothelioma cells. However, the actual nature of the alteration is unclear at present. The finding of different staining profiles with the two antibodies, Mc5 and E29, which belong to the same group, recognise the same epitope and are both affected by in vitro glycosylation needs to be further investigated.
