3.4. GALNT6 Influences HCC Cell Migration and Invasion via Modulation on MUC1. The validity of GALNT6/MUC1 regulatory axis in HCC cells was next investigated by performing rescue experiments. MUC1 overexpression efficiency was firstly detected via RT-qPCR (Figure S1E). Similarly, RT-qPCR analysis was done to examine changes in MMP2 and MMP9. Reduction in MMP2 and MMP9 levels, resulting from GALNT6 silence, was discovered to be recovered by MUC1 overexpression (Figure 4(a)). Supported by wound healing assay, it was discovered that MUC1 overexpression could reverse the inhibition on cell migration which was attributed to GALNT6 silence (Figure 4(b)). The outcomes of Transwell assays further confirmed that the suppressive influences of GALNT6 depletion on cell migration and invasion could be completely countervailed by MUC1 overexpression (Figures 4(c) and 4(d)). To sum up, GALNT6/MUC1 axis is a crucial modulator for HCC cell migration and invasion.
