2.9. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP). ChIP RNA-Binding Protein Immunoprecipitation Kit was applied in ChIP assay for the investigation into the putative correlation between RUNX3 and GALNT6 promoter. The crosslinked chromatin was first cut into fragments (200-1000 bp) for immunoprecipitation with primary antibody against IgG or RUNX3, together with magnetic beads. Subsequent to elution and purification, the precipitated DNAs were analyzed via RT-qPCR.
