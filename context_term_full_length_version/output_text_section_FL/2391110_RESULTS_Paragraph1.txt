RESULTS EMA staining by Immunohistochemistry. The pattern of staining for all antibodies examined was similar, with accentuated staining detectable on the cell membrane (Figure 1). The sensitivity of the different antibody clones for mesothelioma effusion samples ranged from 25% for the VU2G7 and VU4H5 clones to 100% for the Mc5 clone. The E29 clone reacted with 16 (of 19) specimens (Table 3). Most of the antibodies studied were highly specific for malignant cells with no moderate or strongly stained cells being observed in up to 16 specimens of benign reactive effusion studied (Table 3). However the Mc5 clone reacted strongly with over half of the nonmalignant samples (57% false-positive rate). The MA695 clone had weak or equivocal staining on two thirds of these control samples (Table 3). The pattern of reactivity of the Mc5 clone was membrane accentuated in both the malignant and benign specimens.
