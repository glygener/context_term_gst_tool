2.8. Luciferase Reporter Assay. 293T cells were cultured in a 24-well plate and grown up to 70% coverage. The pGL3 Luciferase Reporter Vectors containing GALNT6 promoter with the wild-type or mutant binding site of RUNX3 were constructed. The constructed vectors, as well as pcDNA3.1-RUNX3 or negative control (pcDNA3.1), were transfected into 293 T cells, respectively. The luciferase assay was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol.
