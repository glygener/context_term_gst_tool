Paragraph. Various forms of MUC1 are expressed in mesothelioma. We suggest that the specific hypoglycosylated form of the full length tandem repeat containing MUC1 protein product is a useful target for mesothelioma diagnosis, but possibly the expression of novel MUC1 epitopes may represent a potential therapeutic target. Currently there are promising MUC1 directed therapies being investigated in breast, ovarian and non small cell lung cancer. These include therapies targeting MUC1-associated carbohydrates such as sialyl-Tn (STn, Theratope), MUC1-pulsed dendritic cell vaccines and also the MUC1 peptide-based vaccine BLP-25. Our findings suggest that the role of MUC1-directed therapy in mesothelioma should be investigated.
