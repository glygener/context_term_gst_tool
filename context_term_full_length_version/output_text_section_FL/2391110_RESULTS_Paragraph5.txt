Paragraph. Median CA15-3 concentration in patients with benign asbestos-related disease (either asbestosis and/or pleural plaques) was 38+-6 kU l-1 (range, 14-155 kU l-1); 28% (9 out of 32) of patients with asbestos-related benign disease had CA15-3 levels above the upper limit of normal. There was no significant difference in serum CA15-3 between patients with mesothelioma and patients with benign asbestos-related lung and pleural disease. One of 10 patients with non-malignant pleural effusions examined had elevated serum CA15-3. Median CA15-3 concentration in the serum of healthy controls was 22+-2 kU l-1 (range, 9-43 kU l-1). Median concentrations of CA15-3 were significantly higher in the serum of mesothelioma patients compared to patients with benign effusions (P=0.016) and normal controls (P<0.0001) (Figure 4A).
