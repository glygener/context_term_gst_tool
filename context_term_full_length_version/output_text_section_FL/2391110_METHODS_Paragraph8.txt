Measurement of CA15-3. CA15-3 levels were determined using the IMMULITE 2000 BR-MA (CA15-3) assay (Diagnostic Products Corporation, Los Angeles, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The assay is a sandwich ELISA utilising the monoclonal antibodies 115D8 and DF3. A value above 53 kU l-1 was considered to be outside the normal range of healthy persons. All assays were performed on coded samples by technical staff unaware of the patient's diagnosis.
