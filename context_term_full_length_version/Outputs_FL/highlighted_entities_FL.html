<p><b>1.</b> Current interest in the <span style="color:#0000FF"><span style="color:#0000FF"><span style="color:#0000FF"><span style="color:#0000FF"><span style="color:#0000FF"><span style="color:#0000FF"><span style="color:#0000FF"><span style="color:#0000FF"><span style="color:#0000FF"><span style="color:#0000FF"><span style="color:#0000FF"><span style="color:#0000FF">MUC1</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>/<span style="color:#0000FF"><span style="color:#0000FF"><span style="color:#0000FF"><span style="color:#0000FF">EMA</span></span></span></span> mucin relates to its role in malignancy, and its potential as a therapeutic target.</p>
<p><b>2.</b> MUC1/EMA expression has been observed in the majority of epithelioid <span style="color:#FF0000"><span style="color:#FF0000"><span style="color:#FF0000"><span style="color:#FF0000"><span style="color:#FF0000"><span style="color:#FF0000"><span style="color:#FF0000"><span style="color:#FF0000">mesothelioma</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>s.</p>
<p><b>3.</b> However, little is known of the characteristics of MUC1/EMA in mesothelioma.</p>
<p><b>4.</b> Herein, we studied the cell surface and soluble expression of the MUC1/EMA glycoprotein, and determined the mRNA and genomic expression profiles in mesothelioma.</p>
<p><b>5.</b> We found that the anti-MUC1 antibody, E29, was the most diagnostically useful of seven antibody clones examined with a sensitivity of 84% (16 out of 19 cases) and no false positive results.</p>
<p><b>6.</b> MUC1 mRNA expression was significantly higher in mesothelioma samples than in <span style="color:#FF0000"><span style="color:#FF0000"><span style="color:#FF0000">benign</span></span></span> mesothelial cells.</p>
<p><b>7.</b> No amplification of the MUC1 gene was observed by FISH.</p>
<p><b>8.</b> Seven of 9 mesothelioma samples expressed MUC1-secreted mRNA isoform in addition to the archetypal MUC1/transmembrane form.</p>
<p><b>9.</b> <span style="color:#0000FF">CA15.3</span> (soluble MUC1) levels were significantly higher in the <span style="color:#17e8cf">serum</span> of mesothelioma <span style="color:#f83f93"><span style="color:#f83f93">patients</span></span> than in healthy controls but were not significantly different to levels in patients with benign <span style="color:#FF0000">asbestos-related disease</span>.</p>
<p><b>10.</b> <span style="color:#0000FF">CA15-3</span> in effusions could differentiate malignant from benign effusions but were not specific for mesothelioma.</p>
<p><b>11.</b> Thus, as in other <span style="color:#FF0000">cancers</span>, alterations in MUC1 biology occur in mesothelioma and these results suggest that specific MUC1 characteristics may be useful for mesothelioma diagnosis and should also be investigated as a potential therapeutic target.</p>

<p><b>2.</b> In cases of malignant <span style="color:#FF0000"><span style="color:#FF0000"><span style="color:#FF0000">mesothelioma</span></span></span> there is an increase in the total quantity of MUC1-TM mRNA expressed, a change in the type of MUC1 isoform produced, an alteration in the epitopes of MUC1 expressed on cell surface and an increase in MUC1 gene product detectable in the circulation.</p>
<p><b>3.</b> Currently there are promising MUC1 directed therapies being investigated in <span style="color:#FF0000"><span style="color:#17e8cf"><span style="color:#17e8cf">breast</span></span>, ovarian and non small cell <span style="color:#17e8cf"><span style="color:#17e8cf">lung</span></span> cancer</span>.</p>
<p><b>4.</b> The major clinical role of CA15-3 biomarker is in monitoring <span style="color:#17e8cf">breast</span> carcinoma metastases and the evaluation of response to treatment.</p>
<p><b>5.</b> CA15-3 has previously been found in several small scale studies to be elevated in the <span style="color:#17e8cf">serum</span> and in effusions of <span style="color:#f83f93"><span style="color:#f83f93"><span style="color:#f83f93">patients</span></span></span> with <span style="color:#FF0000"><span style="color:#FF0000"><span style="color:#FF0000">mesothelioma</span></span></span>.</p>
<p><b>6.</b> In the current study, CA15-3 levels were significantly higher in the <span style="color:#17e8cf"><span style="color:#17e8cf">serum</span></span> of mesothelioma patients than healthy controls; however, the finding that levels were elevated in patients with <span style="color:#FF0000">benign <span style="color:#17e8cf">lung</span> and pleural disease</span> suggests that serum CA15-3 will not be useful as a diagnostic aid for mesothelioma.</p>
<p><b>7.</b> Alteration in MUC1 glycosylation has been reported in many malignancies.</p>
<p><b>8.</b> The current antibody studies suggest that glycosylation of MUC1-TM is altered in malignant mesothelioma cells.</p>
<p><b>9.</b> However, the actual nature of the alteration is unclear at present.</p>
<p><b>10.</b> The finding of different staining profiles with the two antibodies, Mc5 and E29, which belong to the same group, recognise the same epitope and are both affected by in vitro glycosylation needs to be further investigated.</p>

<p><b>1.</b> Background <span style="color:#FF0000">Hepatocellular carcinoma</span> (HCC) is a leading cause of <span style="color:#FF0000">cancer</span>-related death worldwide.</p>
<p><b>2.</b> Dysregulation of messenger RNAs (mRNA) has been recognized to be associated with HCC carcinogenesis and development.</p>
<p><b>3.</b> <span style="color:#0000FF">Polypeptide GalNAc Transferase 6</span> (<span style="color:#0000FF"><span style="color:#0000FF">GALNT6</span></span>), an O-type glycosyltransferase, has been confirmed as tumor promoter in different <span style="color:#FF0000">cancers</span>.</p>
<p><b>4.</b> However, the function of GALNT6 in HCC remains to be studied.</p>
<p><b>5.</b> Methods RT-qPCR and western blot experiments were, respectively, performed for evaluating RNA expressions and protein levels.</p>
<p><b>6.</b> Supported by bioinformatics analysis, mechanism assays were conducted for validating the potential relation between different genes.</p>
<p><b>7.</b> Functional assays were implemented to analyze <span style="color:#FF0000">HCC</span> cell migration and invasion after different transfections.</p>
<p><b>8.</b> Results <span style="color:#0000FF"><span style="color:#0000FF"><span style="color:#0000FF"><span style="color:#0000FF"><span style="color:#0000FF"><span style="color:#0000FF">GALNT6</span></span></span></span></span></span> was aberrantly upregulated in <span style="color:#FF0000"><span style="color:#FF0000"><span style="color:#FF0000">HCC</span></span></span> cells.</p>
<p><b>9.</b> Knockdown of GALNT6 could repress HCC cell migration and invasion.</p>
<p><b>10.</b> <span style="color:#0000FF">RUNX3</span> was verified to bind to GALNT6 promoter and activate GALNT6 transcription.</p>
<p><b>11.</b> GALNT6 depletion led to inhibited O-glycosylation and aggravated degradation of <span style="color:#0000FF"><span style="color:#0000FF">MUC1</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>12.</b> MUC1 overexpression could rescue the impeded HCC cell migration and invasion induced by GALNT6 knockdown.</p>
<p><b>13.</b> Conclusion To sum up, <span style="color:#0000FF">GALNT6</span> transcriptionally activated by <span style="color:#0000FF">RUNX3</span> mediated the O-glycosylation of <span style="color:#0000FF">MUC1</span>, thus exerting promoting influence on <span style="color:#FF0000">HCC</span> cell migration and invasion.</p>

<p><b>3.</b> Consistently, after we confirmed that GALNT6 was upregulated in <span style="color:#FF0000"><span style="color:#FF0000"><span style="color:#FF0000">HCC</span></span></span> tissues and cell lines, we also verified GALNT6 could promote HCC cell migration and invasion, implying GALNT6 was an oncogene in HCC.</p>
<p><b>4.</b> Normally, infection of chronic hepatitis B and hepatitis C exists as the major reason for HCC induction, while addiction to alcohol, dietary exposure to aflatoxins or aristolochic acid, and <span style="color:#17e8cf">liver</span> disease metastasis are all risk factors of HCC.</p>
<p><b>5.</b> MUC1 has been much investigated regarding to <span style="color:#FF0000"><span style="color:#FF0000">cancer</span></span> development.</p>
<p><b>6.</b> For instance, MUC1 as a ceRNA participant has been discovered to promote <span style="color:#FF0000">ovarian cancer</span> progression.</p>
<p><b>7.</b> The O-glycans of MUC1 has also been reported as a crucial effector in tumor development.</p>
<p><b>8.</b> As MUC1 is a transmembrane mucin glycoprotein expressed on the surface of almost all epithelial cells, vaccine based on MUC1 has been regarded as a promising method for cancer treatment.</p>
<p><b>9.</b> In our study, implementation of VVA pull down assay and western blot assay jointly certified MUC1 O-glycosylation mediated by GALNT6 could lessen the degradation of MUC1 protein in HCC cells.</p>

<p><b>2.</b> Based on recent studies, the oncogenic role of <span style="color:#0000FF"><span style="color:#0000FF"><span style="color:#0000FF"><span style="color:#0000FF"><span style="color:#0000FF"><span style="color:#0000FF"><span style="color:#0000FF"><span style="color:#0000FF"><span style="color:#0000FF"><span style="color:#0000FF"><span style="color:#0000FF"><span style="color:#0000FF"><span style="color:#0000FF"><span style="color:#0000FF"><span style="color:#0000FF"><span style="color:#0000FF"><span style="color:#0000FF"><span style="color:#0000FF"><span style="color:#0000FF"><span style="color:#0000FF"><span style="color:#0000FF"><span style="color:#0000FF"><span style="color:#0000FF"><span style="color:#0000FF"><span style="color:#0000FF"><span style="color:#0000FF"><span style="color:#0000FF">GALNT6</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> in <span style="color:#FF0000"><span style="color:#17e8cf">breast</span> cancer</span> and <span style="color:#FF0000"><span style="color:#17e8cf">lung</span> adenocarcinoma</span> is dependent on O-glycosylation.</p>
<p><b>3.</b> Previous studies have unveiled the oncogenic role of <span style="color:#0000FF"><span style="color:#0000FF"><span style="color:#0000FF"><span style="color:#0000FF"><span style="color:#0000FF"><span style="color:#0000FF"><span style="color:#0000FF"><span style="color:#0000FF"><span style="color:#0000FF"><span style="color:#0000FF"><span style="color:#0000FF"><span style="color:#0000FF">GALNT6</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> in different <span style="color:#FF0000">cancers</span>, including <span style="color:#FF0000"><span style="color:#17e8cf">breast</span> cancer</span> and <span style="color:#FF0000"><span style="color:#17e8cf">lung</span> adenocarcinoma</span>.</p>
<p><b>4.</b> Hence, we aimed to explore the putative role of GALNT6 in <span style="color:#FF0000"><span style="color:#FF0000"><span style="color:#FF0000"><span style="color:#FF0000"><span style="color:#FF0000"><span style="color:#FF0000"><span style="color:#FF0000"><span style="color:#FF0000">HCC</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>.</p>
<p><b>5.</b> The expression of <span style="color:#0000FF">MUC5AC</span> in LIHC could not be obtained from UALCAN.</p>
<p><b>6.</b> RT-qPCR analysis was then done for the measurement of GALNT6 expression in different cell lines, and the results of which showed GALNT6 expression was much higher in HCC cells than in <span style="color:#800080">THLE-2</span> (Figure 1(b)).</p>
<p><b>7.</b> Furthermore, <span style="color:#800080">Li-7</span> and <span style="color:#800080">Hep 3B</span> (with the highest GALNT6 expression) were selected for subsequent functional assays.</p>
<p><b>8.</b> The knockdown efficiency of si-GALNT6 was determined in advance (Figure S1A), and si-GALNT6-1/2 was chosen for the higher efficiency.</p>
<p><b>9.</b> It was suggested in RT-qPCR analysis that GALNT6 depletion led to a decrease in the levels of <span style="color:#0000FF">MMP2</span> and <span style="color:#0000FF">MMP9</span> (invasion-related genes), suggesting the suppressive impacts of GALNT6 knockdown on HCC cell invasion (Figure 1(c)).</p>
<p><b>10.</b> For further confirmation, <span style="color:#800080">Li-7</span> cells were treated with O-glycosylation inhibitor Benzyl-alpha-GalNAc (BAG).</p>
<p><b>11.</b> The inhibitory influences of GALNT6 knockdown on cell migration and invasion in HCC were further confirmed by Transwell experiments as a decline in migrated and invaded cells could be observed as a result of si-GALNT6-1/2 transfection (Figures 1(e) and 1(f)).</p>
<p><b>12.</b> The above findings together prove that GALNT6, upregulated in HCC tissues and cell lines, can contribute to cell migration and invasion in HCC.</p>
<p><b>13.</b> Taken together, GALNT6 mediates O-glycosylation of MUC1 in HCC cells.</p>
