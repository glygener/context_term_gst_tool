Determination of SIRT1 rs12778366, FGFR2 rs2981582, STAT3 rs744166, and RAGE rs1800625 Single Gene Polymorphisms in Patients with Laryngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma. PURPOSE: To determine the frequency of the genotype of signal transducer and activator of transcription protein 3 (STAT3) rs744166, sirtuin (SIRT1) rs12778366, fibroblast growth factor (FGFR2) rs2981582, and advanced glycosylation end product-specific receptor (RAGE) rs1800625 gene polymorphisms in patients with laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC). METHODS: A total of 944 subjects were evaluated, which includes 144 patients with LSCC and 800 healthy controls. The genotyping of STAT3 rs744166, SIRT1 rs12778366, FGFR2 rs2981582, and RAGE rs1800625 was carried out using the RT-PCR. RESULTS: The analysis of STAT3 rs744166, SIRT1 rs12778366, and FGFR2 rs2981582 gene polymorphisms did not reveal any differences in genotype distribution between the patients with LSCC and the control subjects. However, statistical analysis revealed that genotypes (AA, AG, and GG) of rs1800625 in RAGE gene were distributed statistically significantly differently between patients and controls (61.1%, 30.6%, and 23.6% vs. 72.5%, 25.8%, and 1.8%, respectively; p < 0.001). Additionally, statistical significance was observed in allele distribution between these two groups, i.e., allele G at rs1800625 was more frequently observed in the patient group than in controls (23.6% vs. 14.6%; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: RAGE rs1800625 gene polymorphism may play a significant role in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma development.
